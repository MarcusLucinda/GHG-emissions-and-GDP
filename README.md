## Introduction

Since the industrial revolution, humans have already thrown more than 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide on the atmosphere, with significant increase every year. Climate change consequences are perceptible and increasingly severe, with more common heat waves, desertifications, floodings and hurricanes.\
Although there is a consensus that the emissions should be reduced, even ratified through the Paris agreement, there's still a discussion of who's to blame. Developed countries state that they are creating and applying celan energy technologies, unlike developing countries, which state tha they are industrializing and developed countries got rich in with high emissions in the past, and now it's their turn.\
Climate chanege also causes long term economic impacts, various predictions try to answer how the coutries wealth will respond to the new reality. Sevral analyses point that developed countries will suffer softer impacts than underdeveloped ones.

It was used consuption-based accounting for per capita CO2 emissions./
On behalf of GDP projections in was used Marshall Burke's and his colaborators paper./
All source where the data got scraped are listed at the end.
